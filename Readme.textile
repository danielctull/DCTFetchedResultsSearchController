h1. DCTFetchedResultsSearchController

Easily manage an NSFetchedResultsController and UISearchDisplayController to give searches of a data set stored in Core Data.

*2.0* 
- Code is now written for ARC
- Uses "FRCTableViewDataSources":https://github.com/freerangecode/FRCTableViewDataSources to act as a datasource, this is a requirement for version 2.0

h2. Branch Structure

There is a new branch structure for DCTFetchedResultsSearchController 2.0, *master* and *demo*. Unlike previous versions, *master* is now the branch to use as a submodule.

h3. master

The master branch contains the code and should be used if you want to add these extensions as a git submodule in other projects. It will only contain the class files themselves without the Xcode project or example classes. This is preferable as it will keep your directories clean of any code which is unnecessary to your working project.

To add this project as a submodule you should run the following from inside your project's git repository:

bc. git submodule add git://github.com/danielctull/DCTFetchedResultsSearchController.git

To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual:

bc. git pull origin

h3. demo

This contains an Xcode project that demonstrates the code and is the branch to use to see how to use the code. The demo branch contains a submodule reference to the master branch to bring in the library classes.

To clone the demo branch, while also pulling in any necessary submodules run the following command:

bc. git clone -b demo --recursive git://github.com/danielctull/DCTFetchedResultsSearchController.git

When changing to the demo branch you will need to run through the following set of commands:

bc. git checkout demo
git submodule init
git submodule update

After these you will see the example project and the library code will be in a sub-directory.

h3. Artefacts

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from demo to master. These are files that are ignored by git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf

h2. Examples

Examples of some of these features can be found in the iPhone app delegate.
